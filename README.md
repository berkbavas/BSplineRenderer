# B-Spline Renderer 
Rendering 3D B-splines in ``C++`` using ``Qt``, ``OpenGL`` and ``Eigen``.

B-splines are parametric curves that consist of several Bézier curves whose control points satisfy specific conditions.
I used cubic Bézier curves for the interpolation of knots. Given a set of knots, 
a cubic Bézier curve is generated between each pair of knots. 
Then, these Bézier curves are glued together to form the final curve, the B-spline.
The algorithm for the generation of the curves can be found [here](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~baker/149.1.02w/handouts/dd_splines.pdf). Although it is about 2D B-splines, interpolating 3D B-splines is not so different.
